  This project is designed to dynamically generate a custom README.md file for a user's project.  With a series of prompts and selections, a user is able to create a README.md file quickly, instead of having to waste time creating and writing one from scratch.

## Installation

  <hr>
  
  **To edit/use the application, please follow the steps to pull the repository from GitHub through Git Bash and pull the script into VSCode, provided all three items are already installed on a local network.  It also requires Node.JS to be installed on the local network as well.**

Instillation steps are as follows:

1. Access the repository at [Git Hub] https://github.com/Napica/HW-07-Node-Readme-Gen.
2. Click on the code section (in green) and clone the SSH key.
3. Once the SSH key is cloned, open the terminal through Git Bash.
4. Find or create the folder the user wants to work in and enter the following commands the the Git terminal:
   1. git clone [copied link] (_this will allow access the repository to the local computer._)
   2. git pull (_this will pull all the lines of script from the local repository._)
   3. code . (\*This will extract the code and link the paths to VSCode for review/editing/uploading)
5. In the the terminal, please run "npm install" (as the dependencie should be there) to download the modules necessary for this project to work.  
6.  Once the modules are downloaded, please open up the terminal again and run "node ./index.js".  This will initialize the project and send you on your way to generating a readme File.
